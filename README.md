To get started:

 - clone the project (NOTE: recursive flag since we are using submodules): "git clone --recursive git@github.com:getlittletech/firesensors.git"
 - cd into firesensors. run "npm install"
 - run "react-native run-ios"
 - or start an android emulator and run "react-native run-android"


This project uses a forked react-native-mqtt library, since the original one was not compiling.

I will submit a pull request later.
